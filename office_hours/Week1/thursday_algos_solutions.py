"""

Write a function that accepts a list as input and returns the smallest value
found.  If the list is empty, return None.

"""
Count vowels:
Write a function that accepts a string and returns the number of vowels found.
For this exercise, "a", "e", "i", "o" and "u" are vowels - we will not count
"y" as a vowel.

BONUS: Make the function count "A", "E", etc.  In other words, have this function
handle all strings, regardless of case sensitivity.

"""
Factorial:
In mathematics, n! (read "n factorial") is equal to 1 * 2 * 3 * ... * n.
For example:

2! = 1 * 2 = 2
3! = 1 * 2 * 3 = 6
4! = 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 = 24

Write a function that takes an integer, n, as input and returns the product
1 * 2 * ... * n.  By definition, 0! = 1 and 1! = 1.  If the number
is negative, return 1.
