"""
Frequency distribution (from https://edabit.com/challenge/KKmM4ob5wwPwf8kgS):

Given a list of items, return a dictionary that contains the frequency of each item.
Each key will be an entry from the list, and the value linked to the key will be
the number of occurrences of said key in the list.  If the list is empty, return
an empty dictionary.

Examples:
["M", "P", "C", "C", "P"] returns { "M": 1, "P": 2, "C": 2} as there are 2 "P"s, 2 "C"s and 1 "M"
[1, 5, 8, 5, 5, 3] returns { 1: 1, 5: 3, 8: 1, 3: 1 } (Note it's okay that a key is a number or boolean)
[] returns {}
