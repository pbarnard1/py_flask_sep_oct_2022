Scrabble Score
(From https://edabit.com/challenge/cH5ce3f4QgnreDW4v)
You are given a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary looks like the following:
{"tile": "A", "score": 1}
Your objective is to return the total score from the list of tiles (dictionaries).

Example:
x = [
    {"tile": "P", "score": 3},
    {"tile": "H", "score": 4},
    {"tile": "A", "score": 1},
    {"tile": "N", "score": 1},
    {"tile": "T", "score": 1},
    {"tile": "O", "score": 1},
    {"tile": "M", "score": 3},
]
PHANTOM will return 14 (3 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 3).

Filter Strings from Array
(Modified from this version from Edabit: https://edabit.com/challenge/nunJurLEibCyn8fzn)
Given a list containing strings and numbers, return a new list with all string values removed.
Keep the original order of the values the same.

Examples: 
[3, 8, "hello", -4] should return [3, 8, -4]
["money", "33", 4, "blue", 5] should return [4, 5] ("33" is a string, not a number)
